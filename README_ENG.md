# Career Track

This folder contains assignments from the mandatory educational program at [School 21](https://21-school.ru/we).

### Goal of this track:

---

The **Career Track** aims to help me better understand myself as a programmer, determine my direction in IT, and eventually find a suitable job offer in a company that aligns with my expectations. This will also allow me to work and grow comfortably and productively.

All of the above is achieved through technical assignments. These assignments include modern educational materials that help build an effective learning model. This is done by analyzing market demands, personal capabilities, soft skills, and hard skills. As a result, I can address my weaknesses and improve underdeveloped skills to become competitive in the job market.

### Structure of this track:

---

This is achieved through nine assignments, located in this directory and named as *CT* folders, ranging from 00 to 08 (*a total of 9 projects*).

Each of these folders contains:

* A `src` folder (*project source files*);
* `TASK_RUS.md` and `TASK.md` files (*Russian and English versions of the assignment*);
* A screenshot of the review results from peers (*Peer-to-Peer methodology*).

Each project includes its own technical specification (*TS*) and overall goal, which contribute to achieving the set objectives. Details of the TS are outlined in the `README_RUS.md` and `README.md` files, where educational materials and step-by-step tasks for implementation are described. Some assignments are bonus and optional.

### Project details:

Below is a table with brief descriptions of each assignment and my comments on them.

| **CT00-1** | Career Wheel: Conduct an initial self-analysis and market research, outline job expectations, and set selection criteria, as well as goals for 2 and 5 years. | I didn’t expect this assignment to be challenging, but it turned out that I didn’t know what I wanted. This project helped me create a preliminary image of my future job and outline goals for the future. |
| **CT01-1** | Market analysis and job search for companies that match my expectations. SWOT analysis and table completion from CT00-1.                                      | This assignment was easier than the first one. I took a more detailed look at the job market, which allowed me to create a roadmap of paths toward my goal in School 21.                                      |
